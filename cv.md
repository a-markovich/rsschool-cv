### About Me:
I worked as a design engineer for eight years. There is little development in my work, so I decided to try something new. I was attracted to programming because of the accessibility of training, and I also wanted to test my abilities.
### Skills:
* HTML
* CSS
* Git
* VS Code
### Code example:
```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```
